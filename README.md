# flashcard-generator

This backend app allows users to create two types of flashcards: Basic, and cloze-deleted, each of which corresponds to a different style of flashcard. The basic card has a front and back for traditional flashcards. The cloze card removes selected keywords from a phrase for "fill in the blank" studying.
